-check condition when update personal information => done

- try to connect emailJS to send email to the customer when they pay the bill => done

- create a bill when wen they pay, like it is a copy of order/cart but i have to render it in the field "Your order" Shit

- finish deleting the card when user wanna remove the card => done

- finish all the functions of address like remove address, select current address and show it on the header => done

        - maybe fix the UI that have a radio button on the left of the card, and do the same with the select card so when they select it, i will save it to the localStorage
